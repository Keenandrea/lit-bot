# lit-bot
At the moment, the encompassing files are operational, and output genuine machine-written literature modeled on The Trial by Franz Kafka. KafkaBot isn't nearly as masterful as the real McCoy. I'm working on that. Stay tuned.  

For now, don't hesitate to clone this repo, implement your own especial features, and run it yourself. I highly encourage it.

## How do I Work this Thing?
Easy-peasy. Do you have a Google account? If not, get one. If so, navigate to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb). It's free. _And_ it doesn't require that you download any software (at least it won't during this particular example). Once you've signed into Google Colab, using your Google Account, open a fresh-new Python 3 Notebook.

Next, look for a small arrow, pointing right, on the lefthand-side of your screen. A surefire way of finding the arrow is to scan the lefthand-side of the browser window from top to bottom. When you find it, click it. A side-bar drawer menu pops out. From that menu, click on a tab named __files__, which is the rightmost tab. Once __files__ is clicked, you will see an option named __upload__ click that.

Here's a fun part. The file you choose to upload is the text, or novel, or so-something you yourself would like the machine to emulate. You've got carte-blanche. In this repo, I used text from Kafka's novel, The Trial. You can pull that file and use it in your own project. __Or__ you can navigate to [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/), which is an open-source database chockful of almost-perfectly cleaned literature in .txt format. Proviso: if you choose to upload your own text with which to train your machine, make sure you correlate the names of the files to those defining names in your python code. In my model, pattern-match or find the names __trial_clean.txt__ and __trial_sequences.txt__. Just those two names. Super duck soup.

All rightio, so now you've got your Python Notebook, you've got your text uploaded. Next, sit back and copy/paste from the code into the cells of your Python Notebook in the exact way I have it in the images below. The images and their individual cells are in order. After each cell you have pasted the code inside, mouse over the top-lefthand corner of the cell, and click the small circular __play__ button that appears on the mouse-over. A simple rinse and repeat down the line will do it.
